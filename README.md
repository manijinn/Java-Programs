# Java-Programs
Programs I made for a class. These programs explore important concepts in CS such as dynamic programming, Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms, etc.
These were all done in Java.

Game - A simple program, it involves two pieces on a checkered board and their most optimal moves to race each other to the bottom right corner.

GreedyChildren - Greedy Algorithm. Tries to give out n candies to k children on Halloween. However, each candy has a level of sweetness (like how a coin can have a certain value to it), and each child wants a number of candies that will satisfy their sweetness want. The end result is how many children will be left happy (or angry, if their sweetness demands have not been met).

LCS - Dynamic Programming, "Longest Common Subsequence". We find the longest common subsequence between two strings using a self-created dynamic programming matrix.

MagicMaze - Backtracking. We are stuck in a magic maze, and we must find the exit. There are many ways to do this, but to save time, we ant to find the shortest way to exit. We use Backtracking to find the shortest path to the exit.

Railroad - We find the most cost-efficient route from the start to end, given a certain map of verticies and edges. I implemented my own Kruskals Algo, disjoint sets, and vertex/edge map builder.
